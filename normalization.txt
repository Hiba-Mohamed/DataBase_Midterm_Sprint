Explain how the tables (created using the previous queries) are each in 3NF:

Genre Table: 
Each column contains atomic values, no repeating groups or arrays, satisfing First Normal Form (1NF) requirments. 
The genre_id serves as the primary key, the genre_name is entirely dependent on the genre_id,
meaning that there is no partial dependencies and fulfilling the criteria for Second Normal Form (2NF). 
Furthermore, there are no transitive dependencies, as genre_name is directly associated with the 
primary key without relying on any other non-key attributes satisfying (3NF). 

Movies table:
Each column in the Movies table contains atomic values, ensuring that there are no repeating groups or arrays,
which satisfies the requirements of First Normal Form (1NF). The movie_id serves as the primary key, while 
the attributes movie_title, release_year, genre_id, and director_name are fully functionally dependent on the movie_id. 
This means that if the movie_id changes, all associated values must also change, thereby satisfying the criteria for 
Second Normal Form (2NF). Additionally, a transitive dependency that previously existed has been eliminated by creating a 
separate Genres table and linking the two tables through the genre_id. This restructuring not only removes the transitive
dependency satisfying (3NF) but also effectively reduces redundancy, enhancing the overall efficiency and integrity of the database design.

Customer table:
Each column contains atomic values, no repeating groups or arrays, satisfing First Normal Form (1NF) requirments. 
The customer_id serves as the primary key, all the non-key attributes entirely depend on it,
meaning that there is no partial dependencies and fulfilling the criteria for Second Normal Form (2NF). 
Furthermore, there are no transitive dependencies,satisfying (3NF). 

Rentals Table:
Each column contains atomic values, no repeating groups or arrays, satisfing First Normal Form (1NF) requirments. 
the primary key is  the rental_id all the non-key attributes entirely depend on it,
meaning that there is no partial dependencies and fulfilling the criteria for Second Normal Form (2NF). 
Furthermore, there are no transitive dependencies,satisfying (3NF).
